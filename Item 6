# Description: A number guessing game that gives the user 7 chances to guess a mystery number.

# I: user Guess (1-100), user playAgain (Y/N), Mystery Constant (Random Int), Attempt Constant (0), 
#    Attempt Cap Constant (7), WIN condition CONSTANT (Default False), Preset user Guess (0),
# P: Validate user inputs (user Guess, user playAgain), Check user Guess == OR < OR > Mystery Constant,
#    count Attempts made (Attempt Constant, Attempt Cap Constant)
# O: If user Guess is TOO LOW, TOO HIGH, or == Mystery Constant, If user Guess is INVALID INPUT, 
#    if user playAgain is INVALID INPUT
