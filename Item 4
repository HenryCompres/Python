# Description: A list game that the user input numbers into for cool results.

# Input: my answer(constant), playagain(constant), number of questioned asked(constant, 5), list mentioned, user input values
# Process: ask to play if yes, ask user 5 questions(random number input), append user inputs to list for display, 
#          sort list in ASC, length of list, delete an item from list, 
# Output: Display the title, intro, rules, list, sorted list(ASC), length of list, sum of list, average of list,
